# Welcome to my website!

I am **Teng Suan**, a final-year undergraduate at NUS (National University of Singapore) currently pursuing a Bachelor of Business Administration (Accountancy) with a second specialisation in Business Analytics.

I am currently looking for my first analytics-related internship/full-time role. My areas of interest lie in business/data analytics or any adjacent data-related fields, such as data engineering, data science and machine learning. 

On this website, you will find a selection of my personal projects, as well as my curriculum vitae which you can easily download.

Please feel free to [contact me](mailto:mail.ngtengsuan@gmail.com) if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential data projects.
