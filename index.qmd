# Welcome to my website!

I am **Teng Suan**, a Year 3 undergraduate at NUS (National University of Singapore) currently pursuing a Bachelor of Business Administration (Accountancy) with a second specialisation in Business Analytics.

My areas of interest lie in business and data analytics, data science, with occasional forays into web app development and dashboard creation. I plan to learn other data tools such as Tableau and Power BI in the future to further expand my technical toolkit for analytics.

I have recently completed an 8-month long audit internship at KPMG Singapore while studying at the same time (under the Work-Study Internship Programme or WSIP), where I was exposed to different types of audit and audit clients, and which further developed my personal soft skills and technical skills (especially in Microsoft Excel).

I am hoping to purse another internship with KPMG this winter season (December 2023), this time in a more technology-adjacent role for exposure to a broader range of industries and to acquire other consulting-related skills.

On this website, you will find a selection of my personal blog posts and published projects, as well as my curriculum vitae which you can easily download.

Please feel free to [contact me](mailto:mail.ngtengsuan@gmail.com) if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects.
