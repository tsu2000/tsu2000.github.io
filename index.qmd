# Welcome to my website!

I am **Teng Suan**, a Year 3 undergraduate at NUS (National University of Singapore) currently pursuing a Bachelor of Business Administration (Accountancy) with a second specialisation in Business Analytics.

My areas of interest lie in business analytics or any adjacent analytics-related fields, including data visualisation, data analytics, data science and machine learning. I am currently looking for my first analytics internship role this summer break from June 2024 to August 2024.

On this website, you will find a selection of my portfolio projects, as well as my curriculum vitae which you can easily download.

Please feel free to [contact me](mailto:mail.ngtengsuan@gmail.com) if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects.
