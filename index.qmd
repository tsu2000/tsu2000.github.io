# See how I bring my ideas to life.

I am Teng Suan, a final-year undergraduate at the National University of Singapore (NUS), pursuing a Bachelor of Business Administration (Accountancy) with a second specialisation in Business Analytics.

I am currently seeking my first analytics-related role, with a keen interest in business analytics, data analytics, or data-driven consulting.

This website showcases a selection of my personal projects and provides access to my curriculum vitae for download.

If you have any questions or would like to discuss potential data projects or job prospects, feel free to [contact me](mailto:mail.ngtengsuan@gmail.com).
