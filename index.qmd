# Welcome to my website!

I am **Teng Suan**, a Year 3 undergraduate at NUS (National University of Singapore) currently pursuing a Bachelor of Business Administration (Accountancy) with a second specialisation in Business Analytics.

My areas of interest lie in business analytics, data science and machine learning, with a minor interest in web app development and dashboard creation. I am currently looking for analytics-related roles this summer break from May 2024 to August 2024.

On this website, you will find a selection of my portfolio projects, as well as my curriculum vitae which you can easily download.

Please feel free to [contact me](mailto:mail.ngtengsuan@gmail.com) if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects.
