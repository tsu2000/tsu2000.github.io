It consists of two major parts: The first part is a data visualisation of the probability distribution drop rates of 5★ characters/weapons which changes based on the number of pulls since obtaining a 5★ character, and the second part allows users to simulate their chances of obtaining a 4/5★ character based on their user inputs. This app was the first time I used the matplotlib package to create a relatively large web application, and I also had to brush up on my probability and statistical knowledge to ensure that the theoretical probability values matched up with what was happening in-game. An issue with the first app was that communication with players could be a challenge as average players could not fully understand why the data plots were as such, so I subsequently added more detailed yet straightforward explanations to the app which gave it a better reception."

    "title": "Structured Query Langauge: Unraveling the language of databases",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Structured Query Language (SQL) is a powerful and ubiquitous language that plays a central role in the world of data management and database systems. Whether you are a budding data analyst or an aspiring software developer, understanding SQL is essential for effectively working with relational databases. In this blog post, we will unravel the mysteries of SQL, exploring its purpose, structure, and introducing some of its important commands.\n\nWhat is SQL? SQL, short for Structured Query Language, is a domain-specific language designed for managing, querying, and manipulating relational databases. It provides a standardized way to interact with databases, making it possible to store, retrieve, update, and delete data efficiently. SQL allows users to define database structures, perform complex data operations, and ensure data integrity, all through concise and powerful commands.\nKey SQL Commands:\n\nSELECT: The SELECT statement is one of the most fundamental commands in SQL. It allows you to retrieve data from one or more database tables. You can specify the columns to fetch, apply filters using the WHERE clause, and even perform aggregate functions like SUM, COUNT, AVG, etc.\nINSERT: The INSERT statement is used to add new records to a database table. It allows you to specify the table name and the values to be inserted into each column, creating new rows of data.\nUPDATE: The UPDATE statement is employed to modify existing records in a database table. You can use the SET clause to update specific columns’ values and use the WHERE clause to filter the rows to be updated.\nDELETE: The DELETE statement is used to remove records from a database table. Like the UPDATE statement, it can also be combined with the WHERE clause to selectively delete specific rows.\n\nCreating and Modifying Database Structures:\n\nCREATE TABLE: The CREATE TABLE statement is used to create a new database table. It defines the table’s columns, their data types, and any constraints like primary keys or foreign keys.\nALTER TABLE: The ALTER TABLE statement allows you to modify an existing table’s structure. You can add or drop columns, change data types, or add constraints.\n\nFiltering and Sorting Data:\n\nWHERE: The WHERE clause is used to filter data based on specific conditions. It allows you to retrieve only the records that meet the specified criteria.\nORDER BY: The ORDER BY clause is used to sort the retrieved data in ascending or descending order based on one or more columns.\n\nSyntax Variations:\nWhile SQL serves as the standardized language for interacting with relational databases, it’s important to note that different database management systems may have their own variations in SQL syntax. For example, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and Oracle Database, among others, may exhibit subtle differences in how they handle certain SQL commands, data types, and even functions.\n\nThese syntax variations may include slight differences in naming conventions, data type handling, date formats, and more. Therefore, when working with different database systems, it’s essential to be aware of these nuances and adapt the SQL queries accordingly.\nSQL is the cornerstone of data management, enabling efficient data retrieval, manipulation, and organization within relational databases. By mastering key SQL commands, you can harness the full potential of databases and leverage data-driven insights for decision-making and application development. As you dive deeper into the world of SQL, you’ll unlock endless possibilities to explore, analyze, and extract meaningful information from vast datasets."

    "title": "The Irreplaceable Role of Auditors: Why Their Expertise Endures",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In today’s fast-paced technological landscape, the rise of artificial intelligence and automation has sparked debates about the future of various professions, including auditors. As machines become more advanced, the question arises: Will auditors be replaced by algorithms and AI-driven tools? In this blog post, we will explore why auditors are unlikely to be replaced anytime soon and why their indispensable expertise remains crucial in ensuring trust, transparency, and accuracy in financial reporting.\n\nThe Human Touch: Auditors are not merely number-crunching machines. They possess a unique blend of human judgment, intuition, and critical thinking. While automation can streamline repetitive tasks and data analysis, it lacks the context-driven decision-making that auditors bring to the table. Auditors consider business intricacies, industry knowledge, and company-specific risks to offer a comprehensive and nuanced evaluation that goes beyond raw data.\nComplex and Dynamic Scenarios: Modern businesses operate in complex and ever-changing environments. Auditors must navigate intricate financial structures, diverse accounting standards, and evolving regulatory landscapes. Their adaptability, problem-solving skills, and ability to interpret non-financial information ensure that audits remain accurate and relevant in a rapidly evolving world.\nNon-Financial Factors: Financial statements alone do not provide a holistic picture of an organization. Auditors scrutinize non-financial factors, such as corporate culture, ethical practices, and risk management, to assess an entity’s overall health and compliance. Incorporating these qualitative assessments into an audit requires human judgment and the ability to assess intangible aspects of an organization’s operations.\nRelationship Building and Communication: Auditors interact with key stakeholders, including clients, shareholders, and regulators. Their interpersonal skills and effective communication are vital in understanding business operations, building trust, and explaining complex financial matters to various audiences. Human interaction and empathetic communication are hard to replicate through automation.\nFraud Detection and Ethical Considerations: Auditors play a critical role in detecting fraudulent activities and ensuring adherence to ethical standards. Their intuition, experience, and skepticism act as a safeguard against financial malpractices. Ethical judgment and situational awareness are attributes that cannot be programmed into machines.\nEvolving Role of Auditors: Rather than being replaced, auditors are evolving to keep pace with technological advancements. They are embracing data analytics, artificial intelligence, and automation to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of audits. Technology serves as a tool to augment auditors’ capabilities, not a substitute for their expertise.\n\nThe role of auditors extends far beyond the boundaries of data analysis. Their human expertise, ethical judgment, adaptability, and critical thinking remain invaluable assets in safeguarding financial integrity, corporate governance, and investor confidence. While technology continues to shape the audit profession, auditors are indispensable in ensuring trust, transparency, and accountability in an ever-changing financial landscape. The human touch, combined with the power of technology, will continue to fortify the auditors’ relevance and resilience in the years to come."
