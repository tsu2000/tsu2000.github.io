A web app to identify the financial drivers of profitability among SGX-listed firms using OLS regression and robust econometric techniques. The app analyzes how lagged financial indicators (e.g. debt ratios, margins, asset turnover) affect current profitability (ROA, ROE, etc.), with support for heteroskedasticity-robust errors and regression diagnostics. Users can also filter by industry and financial year-end. Financial data from SGX firms was collected via the `yfinance` API in a Jupyter Notebook for pre-processing before analysis shown [here](https://github.com/tsu2000/sgx_ols_perf/blob/main/scrape_sgx_financials.ipynb).
