## exeRcise book

The most challenging web application I have created so far. One of my tutors had a Python package for beginners consisting of basic programming questions. Since I was interested in using it for R, I created my own Shiny app and modified the questions to suit the R programming language and syntax better. The end result is a website I can confidently say I am proud of. This Shiny web application is the only one that is open to pull requests and can be updated directly from changes made in GitHub through GitHub actions.

A basic arithmetic quiz with several different adjustable parameters, such as time taken for the quiz, the number of questions set, and the arithmetic operations to be used in the quiz. This app helped me learn the basics of Shiny such as the reactive programming aspect of Shiny, the basic control flow of the web app and how to manage data processing in a logical and reasonable manner. Also dabbled a little in JavaScript to make the UI/UX feel straightforward and easy to use.

## MouseHunt Trap Statistics and Machine Learning

The very first web app I made in Shiny. A fun web app which shows the possible associations between the different attributes of traps (weapons, bases, charms) in the idle game MouseHunt. I learnt some basic data visualisation skills in R, some basic machine learning algorithms, and how to read data in from `.csv` files and display them in Shiny. Unfortunately the app is virtually useless from a gameplay perspective. But it looks cool though!

## Basic Stock Trading App

A basic, relatively barebones stock trading app made using the `quantmod` package. The app allows users to select several different stock tickers at once and view their trend as a line chart over a selected time period. It also shows the last publicly traded price. There is also a list of around 300,000 stock tickers and their corresponding companies displayed for easier user access, although the data may currently be out-of-date. Note: All data is from Yahoo Finance, and their value of stocks is reflective in their local currency.
