<a href="https://github.com/tsu2000/bank_churn_analysis/tree/main" target="_blank">Code</a><br>

A GitHub repository featuring data analysis and predictive modeling for a bank customer churn dataset (from Kaggle) using Jupyter. The project addresses the business objective of identifying customers likely to churn, enabling targeted retention strategies. The project includes data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) performed using `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and other Python libraries, with outputs saved for reproducibility. Classification machine learning techniques with `sklearn`, including model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning, are applied to predict customer churn. All code and outputs are reproducible, showcasing a structured and transparent approach to data analysis.

<a href="https://github.com/tsu2000/small_data_projects_ipynb/tree/main" target="_blank">Code</a><br>

A collection of Jupyter notebooks consisting of EDA on various subjects, with data analysis and data visualisation projects using `pandas`, `matplotlib` and other relevant libraries all in Jupyter notebooks with visible outputs and code for reproducability, written in Python. A variety of data visualisation and analysis packages were used. All datasets used in the projects are from Kaggle.

An esoteric web game built with Flask which allows users to play an modified version of the classic game "Rock, Paper, and Scissors" with 2 additional moves, "Spock" and "Lizard". The website is hosted for free on PythonAnywhere.com, so the code is not shown publicly on GitHub.
