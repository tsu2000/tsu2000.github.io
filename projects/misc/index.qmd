## Jupyter Notebooks - Small Data Analysis Projects

A collection of Jupyter notebooks with some of my small(ish) data analysis and visualisation projects all in Jupyter notebooks with visible outputs and code for reproducability, written in Python. A variety of data visualisation and analysis packages were used. All datasets used in the projects are from Kaggle.

## C/C++ Small Projects

<a href="https://github.com/tsu2000/small_c_and_cpp_projects/tree/main" target="_blank">Code</a><br>

My attempt at understanding programming at a lower level by attempting some basic projects in the C and C++ programming languages. Download and compile the code files directly from GitHub on your local machine to test out the code, if you dare.

## Flask Web App

A very basic web game built with Flask which allows users to play an extended version of the classic game "Rock, Paper, and Scissors" with 2 additional moves, "Spock" and "Lizard". The website is hosted for free on PythonAnywhere.com, so the code is not shown publicly on my GitHub profile.
