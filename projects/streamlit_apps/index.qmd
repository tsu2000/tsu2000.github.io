<a href="https://audit-ml.streamlit.app" target="_blank">Link to web app</a> \| <a href="https://github.com/tsu2000/audit_risk" target="_blank">Code</a><br>

A simple classification machine learning project in Python that attempts to make use of the `scikit-learn` library in Python to try and accurately predict whether a firm is fraudulent using different types of classification models (KNN, Random Forest etc.), and is trained on historical data from diverse firms, where fraudulent activities were previously detected during audits. The dataset is from Kaggle.

<a href="https://insurance-ml.streamlit.app" target="_blank">Link to web app</a> \| <a href="https://github.com/tsu2000/insurance" target="_blank">Code</a><br>

A basic regression machine learning project in Python which aims to accurately predict insurance charges for an individual based on several input factors, such as age, BMI, number of children etc. and uses the `scikit-learn` library to determine the accuracy and precision of the regression model (such as linear, ridge etc.) and predict charges. The dataset is from Kaggle.

<a href="https://binomtree.streamlit.app" target="_blank">Link to web app</a> \| <a href="https://github.com/tsu2000/binom_tree" target="_blank">Code</a><br>

A web application designed for students studying options pricing, offering an interactive Binomial Options Pricing Model (or CRR Model) tool. It allows users to create and visualize a binomial tree model with custom parameters, export data to Excel and PDF files, and provides detailed explanations of the model's workings.

<a href="https://tele-dash.streamlit.app" target="_blank">Link to web app</a> \| <a href="https://github.com/tsu2000/tele_dashboard" target="_blank">Code</a><br>

An interactive web dashboard which shows detailed insights about users and messages in any Telegram chat group. Users must have [Telegram Desktop](https://desktop.telegram.org) installed to use this app. Do note that currently the app is unable to process chat files greater than 200 MB due to resource constraints imposed on the free tier by Streamlit Community Cloud.
