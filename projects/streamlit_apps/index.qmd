title: Streamlit Projects
subtitle: "Here are some of my projects written in the Python programming language using the `Streamlit` library in Python to create interactive web applications. While Streamlit Community Cloud is generous with their free hosting services, there may also be resource limits and some apps may exceed these limits, occasionally crashing the web app."

## GPA Calculator - for NUS students

<img src="img/nus_gpa.png" style="height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"/>

<a href="https://nus-cap.streamlit.app" target="_blank">Link to web app</a> \| <a href="https://github.com/tsu2000/nus_cap_calculator" target="_blank">Code</a><br>

A convenient web app which allows NUS (National University of Singapore) to keep track of the course they have taken in a `.xlsx` spreadsheet and provide detailed statistics on their GPA. All data on courses is provided by the NUSMods API [here](https://api.nusmods.com/v2/).

## Telegram Message Dashboard

<a href="https://tele-dash.streamlit.app" target="_blank">Link to web app</a> \| <a href="https://github.com/tsu2000/tele_dashboard" target="_blank">Code</a><br>

This is an interactive web dashboard which shows detailed insights about users and messages in any Telegram chat group. Users must have [Telegram Desktop](https://desktop.telegram.org) installed to use this app. Do note that currently the app is unable to process chat files greater than 200 MB due to resource constraints imposed on the free tier by Streamlit Community Cloud.

## SQL Sandbox

<a href="https://sqlbox.streamlit.app" target="_blank">Link to web app</a> \| <a href="https://github.com/tsu2000/sql_box" target="_blank">Code</a><br>

This is my attempt at making a website similar to [sqlzoo.net](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial) where users can practise their SQL skills in a sandbox environment based on the given question prompt. The app makes use of SQLite 3 to simulate a database with multiple schemas, and it only recognises SQLite3 commands when executing.

## Machine Learning (Classification) - Audit Risk Dataset

<a href="https://audit-ml.streamlit.app" target="_blank">Link to web app</a> \| <a href="https://github.com/tsu2000/audit_risk" target="_blank">Code</a><br>

A simple classification machine learning project in Python that attempts to make use of the `scikit-learn` library in Python to try and accurately predict whether a firm is fraudulent using different types of classification models (KNN, Random Forest etc.), and is trained on historical data from diverse firms, where fraudulent activities were previously detected during audits. The dataset is from Kaggle.

## Machine Learning (Regression) - Insurance Dataset

<a href="https://insurance-ml.streamlit.app" target="_blank">Link to web app</a> \| <a href="https://github.com/tsu2000/insurance" target="_blank">Code</a><br>

A simple regression machine learning project in Python which aims to accurately predict insurance charges for an individual based on several input factors, such as age, BMI, number of children etc. and uses the `scikit-learn` library to determine the accuracy and precision of the regression model (such as linear, ridge etc.) and predict charges. The dataset is from Kaggle.

## Genshin Impact Gacha Wish Simulator

<a href="https://gi-wish.streamlit.app" target="_blank">Link to web app</a> \| <a href="https://github.com/tsu2000/genshin_wishes" target="_blank">Code</a><br>

A web app for calculating the chances of obtaining a 4/5â˜… character or weapon based on their user inputs in the RPG Genshin Impact. Some statistical knowledge may be required to fully understand and use application. All probabilities used are theoretical rates and may not reflect real-life experiences.
